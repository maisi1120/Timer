# Overview
This project is based on the Pomodoro Technique, using `Graphical User Interface (GUI)` and `tkinter` module. The goal of this project is to beat procrastination and improve your focus one Pomodoro at a time.

# How Pomodoro Technique Works?
When you start the Pomodoro, the timer will start the countdown, meaning that your Pomodoro has just started.

After **25 minutes** have passed, a new timer will be open to show the message **"Break"**, so it's time for a **Short Break**. It lasts **5 minutes**.

Once the short break time is over, another timer will be open telling you it's **"Work"**, and another session of 25 minutes of work will be started.

This process will be repeated **4 times**, but the last break (**Long Break**) will last **25 minutes**.
